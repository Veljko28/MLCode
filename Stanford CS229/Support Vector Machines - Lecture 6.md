## Multi-variate Bernoulli Event Model

The Multi-variate Bernoulli Event Model is a statistical model used to analyze the occurrence of multiple binary events simultaneously. It assumes that each event has its own probability of success or failure, and the events are independent of each other. The model allows for the estimation of the probabilities and provides a framework for making predictions and drawing inferences based on observed event outcomes.

## Multinomial Event Model

Similar to the multi-variate Bernoulli event model by without the binary concept. It can work with data that produces more than just 0's or 1's. This is the more general case of the two mentioned.

## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find an optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the largest possible margin. The algorithm maps input data points into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it searches for the best decision boundary. SVMs are effective in handling high-dimensional data and can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets by using kernel functions. They have been widely applied in various fields such as image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics.

Here we can find two important concepts that need to be implemented and they are **functional distance and geometrical distance.** They can be used to calculate best geometrical distance to the given data. There might be more than one line that can divide the plain so that the different labeled points fall on each of the sides. Using this geometrical distance we can find the line that best divides the given field.
