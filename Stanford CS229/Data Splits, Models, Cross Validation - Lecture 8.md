## Bias/Variance

1. Bias: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. It measures how far off the predictions of the model are from the true values. A high bias means the model is overly simplistic and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in underfitting. Underfitting occurs when a model is not able to learn the training data well and performs poorly on both the training and testing data. Examples of high bias models include linear models attempting to fit complex non-linear relationships. 

2. Variance: Variance refers to the sensitivity of a model to fluctuations or noise in the training data. It measures how much the predictions of the model vary when trained on different subsets of the data. A high variance means the model is too sensitive to the training data and captures noise or random fluctuations instead of the true underlying patterns. High variance leads to overfitting, where the model performs very well on the training data but poorly on unseen or testing data. Complex models with many parameters, such as decision trees with unlimited depth, are prone to high variance.


## Regularization 

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of models. It involves adding a regularization term to the loss function during the training process, which helps to control the complexity of the model.

The regularization term penalizes complex models by adding a cost proportional to the magnitude of the model parameters. This encourages the model to learn simpler patterns and reduces its sensitivity to noise in the training data.


## Hold-out cross validation

Hold-out cross-validation involves splitting the available dataset into two distinct parts: a training set and a validation set (also called a hold-out set). The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set to estimate its generalization performance.

It is a simple and quick method for assessing model performance when the dataset is relatively large. However, it may not be suitable when the dataset is small or imbalanced, as it can result in high variance due to the limited number of samples in the validation set. In such cases, techniques like k-fold cross-validation or stratified cross-validation are often preferred.
