## Kernel Function

In machine learning, a kernel function is a mathematical function that measures the similarity between pairs of data points in a higher-dimensional feature space. It is commonly used in kernel methods, such as support vector machines (SVMs), to transform input data into a more expressive representation where linear separation is possible.

The kernel function calculates the dot product or similarity between two input vectors without explicitly mapping them to the higher-dimensional space. By using kernel functions, the computational burden of working in high-dimensional feature spaces is avoided.

Kernel functions possess several important properties, such as positive definiteness and symmetry, which ensure the resulting kernel matrix is valid and useful for learning algorithms. Some popular kernel functions include the linear kernel, polynomial kernel, Gaussian (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel. Each kernel has its own characteristics and is suitable for different types of data and learning tasks.

## Gaussian Kernel

A Gaussian kernel, also known as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, is a popular kernel function used in machine learning and other related fields. It derives its name from the shape of the Gaussian probability distribution curve. The Gaussian kernel measures the similarity between data points based on their Euclidean distance in the input space.

The Gaussian kernel is defined as:

K(x, x') = exp(-γ * ||x - x'||^2)

In this equation, x and x' are input vectors representing data points, ||.|| denotes the Euclidean distance between the vectors, and γ is a parameter known as the bandwidth or width of the kernel.

The Gaussian kernel works by assigning higher similarity (or weight) to data points that are closer together and gradually decreasing similarity as the distance between points increases. The parameter γ controls the smoothness of the kernel, with smaller values making the kernel wider and smoother, while larger values make it narrower and more localized.

When used in machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), the Gaussian kernel enables nonlinear decision boundaries by mapping the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space.


Basically by using kernels we can map the input in a multidimensional space and use some sort of function to divide the input in this space. It is a way to abstract the data and divide it that way.
