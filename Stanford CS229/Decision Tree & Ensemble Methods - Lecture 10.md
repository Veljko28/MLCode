## Decision Trees

Decision trees are a versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They represent a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome or class label. Decision trees recursively partition the data based on feature values, aiming to maximize the homogeneity of the target variable within each subset. They are interpretable, easy to understand, and can handle both categorical and numerical data. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting and may not generalize well to unseen data, which can be addressed using techniques like pruning or ensemble methods like random forests.

## Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods in machine learning involve combining multiple individual models to create a stronger and more accurate predictive model. The idea behind ensemble methods is that by aggregating the predictions of multiple models, the overall performance can be improved compared to using a single model.

There are different types of ensemble methods, including:

## Bagging - Bootstrap Aggregation 

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): In this method, multiple models are trained on different subsets of the training data, created through bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement). The final prediction is obtained by averaging or voting the predictions of the individual models.

## Boosting

Boosting: Boosting is an iterative ensemble method where models are trained sequentially. Each subsequent model focuses on correcting the mistakes made by the previous models. The final prediction is obtained by combining the predictions of all the models.

## Random Forest

Random Forest combines the concepts of bagging and decision trees. It creates an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of features. The final prediction is obtained by averaging or voting the predictions of the individual trees.
