Arthur Samuel defined Machine Learning as the field of study that allows computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. He famously created the first machine learning program to play checkers. The computer became better than him at checkers which was a first.

## Supervised Learning

Most widely used type of learning. It is useful for classification problems where we have a good amount of data represented on the x and y axis and given a new value of x we can retrieve the value of y based on the previous input. We get a rough estimation of the probability or the average value that would be on the y axis. These are the most basic types of graphs / machine learning algorithms.

**Example:**
Say you are trying to sell a house. You input all the house sizes on the x axis and their price on the y axis of all the houses that have been sold or are currently on sale in your area. Now you create a line between all these prices and sizes. Now place your house size on the x axis is get an approximate value of your house.

## Unsupervised Learning

In this type of learning the machine is given only the data and it has to find the connections between the given data. You don't tell the computer this is good and this is bad or this is true or this is false. You have it find out based on the grouping itself where the data belongs and given more input the data will be mapped to their place. This could be used for coloring of a directed graph. One example given by Andrew Ng is that the machine could read a lot of articles and decide that they are on the same topic even though it doesn't understand the topic or what it's about. 

People in marketing use this to cluster their customers together. Given the database set of users you can find what is common between them and make a group out of them. This way you can promote your products better to each specific group based on their preferences. 


## Reinforcement learning 

Just like you would train a dog by letting it do whatever it wants and telling it "good dog", "bad dog", you can do with a machine. Rewarding the good actions it produces and not rewarding / punishing the bad actions. This way the professionals at Stanford made a self-flying helicopter.
