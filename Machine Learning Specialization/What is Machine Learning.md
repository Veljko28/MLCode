# What is machine learning?

"Filed of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuels

There are two types:
- Supervised learning
	- Regression
	- Classification
- Unsupervised learning
	- Recommender systems
	- Reinforcement learning

**Supervised learning** is used most in real-world applications, and has seen the most rapid advancements. Supervised learning algorithms are those which learn mappings between input and output labels.

**Regression** - predicting a number of infinitely many possible outputs  (mostly by fitting a line)
**Classification** - predicting a number of n possible outputs (we have n classes that could be the right answer). An example might be a program that tells the difference between cats and dogs. The number of classes is 2 so n = 2.

In **unsupervised learning** we're given data that isn't associated with any label data y. Data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y. Unsupervised learning finds the structure or pattern in the data that might be interesting.

Clustering is the process of grouping data into classes.

Dimensionality reduction - Compress data using fewer numbers.

Anomaly detection - Find unusual data points.
