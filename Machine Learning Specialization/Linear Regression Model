# Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model fits a straight line trough the data, and then for any new input it gives the corresponding value (where the line connects to the model prediction).

x = "input" variable 
y = "output" or "target" variable
m = number of training examples
(x, y) = single training example

f(x) = wx+b; w - weights; b - bias
